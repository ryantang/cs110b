// 11. Write a function with the following signature: void noNegatives(int* x). The function
//     should accept the address of an int variable. If the value of this integer is
//     negative then it should set it to zero.
//     Place the prototype for this function above the main function, and the definition
//     below main().
// 12. Invoke the function twice: once with the address of x as the argument, and once with
//     the address of y.  Use x or y for the argument (not p1 or p2).

// 13. Use p2 to display the values in x and y (this will require both assignment statements
//     and cout statements).  You can use x and y in assignment statements, but not in your
//     cout statement. This should produce the output
//
//     x is: 0

// 16. Use only p2 and y (not a) to initialize the second element of a with the value of y.
//     Leave p2 pointing to the first element of a. Don't use pointer arithmetic.
//     Hint: don't forget that pointers and arrays are the same thing.  ("Pointer arithmetic"

//     pointing to the first element of a.   Don't use pointer arithmetic.
cout << "#18: The address of the second element is " << &p2[1] << endl;

// 19. Use p1, p2, and temp to swap the values in the two elements of array 'a'.
//     (first point p1 at a[0], then point p2 at a[1], then do not use "a" again. After this
//     the swapping steps should look very similar to step 10. Don't use a swap function.)

//     (The first element should be 99, the second 0).
cout << "#20: The first element in a[] is " << a[0];
cout << " and the second element in a[] is " << a[1] << endl;


// 21. Write a function named 'swap' that accepts two pointers to integers as arguments, and
//     then swaps the contents of the two integers. Do not use any reference parameters.  Do
//     not use C++'s swap() function.   Place the function prototype for swap() above the main()
//     function, and place the definition of swap() below main().
// 22. Invoke your swap() function with the addresses of x and y (using the address-of
//     operator in the arguments), then print their values.  (x should be 99, y should be 0).
